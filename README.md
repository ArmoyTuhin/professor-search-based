# Professor Search - AI-Powered Research Management

## The Story

Searching for professors and managing your research contacts is a lengthy and hectic work. As someone pursuing a PhD or MSc in foreign countries, you spend countless hours scouring university websites, manually extracting professor information, and tracking your outreach efforts.

This process is time-consuming and takes away from what matters most: your research and applications.

That's why I built this AI-powered professor search and management system. Using artificial intelligence, it automates the tedious work of finding and organizing professors, allowing you to focus on your academic journey.
